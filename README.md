# Local Traffic, Statistical Summaries and Inference

### Overview

- basic statistics (distributions, confidence intervals, hypothesis testing)
- visualizations
- EDA

we're going to take a look at the number of traffic accidents and driving licenses issued in Saudi Arabia. We'll seek to identify trends in the data and combine our data analysis with outside research to identify likely factors influencing the outcomes of traffic accidents in the various regions in Saudi Arabia.

Generally speaking, you will be asked to come up with a data science problem. Here's a specific prompt that should help you craft this statement:
> New traffic rules and fines were [implemented in October 2016](http://live.saudigazette.com.sa/article/164574/New-traffic-laws-in-15-days). As an analyst at the General Department of Traffic under the Ministry of Interior, you are a part of a team that tracks traffic accidents and gives policy recommendations that are best to help reduce injuries and casualties on the road. Your report should be geared toward **non-technical** executives with the General Department and you will use the provided data and outside research to make recommendations about how the General Department might work to reduce traffic accidents in a **region of your choice**.

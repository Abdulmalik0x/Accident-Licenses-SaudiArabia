### Overview

Our first module in DSI covers:
- basic statistics (distributions, confidence intervals, hypothesis testing)
- many Python programming concepts
- programmatically interacting with files and directories
- visualizations
- EDA
- working with Jupyter notebooks for development and reporting

You might wonder if you're ready to start doing data science. While you still have **tons** to learn, there are many aspects of the data science process that you're ready to tackle. Project 1 aims to allow you to practice and demonstrate these skills.

For our first project, we're going to take a look at the number of traffic accidents and driving licenses issued in Saudi Arabia. We'll seek to identify trends in the data and combine our data analysis with outside research to identify likely factors influencing the outcomes of traffic accidents in the various regions in Saudi Arabia.

Generally speaking, you will be asked to come up with a data science problem. Here's a specific prompt that should help you craft this statement:
> New traffic rules and fines were [implemented in October 2016](http://live.saudigazette.com.sa/article/164574/New-traffic-laws-in-15-days). As an analyst at the General Department of Traffic under the Ministry of Interior, you are a part of a team that tracks traffic accidents and gives policy recommendations that are best to help reduce injuries and casualties on the road. Your report should be geared toward **non-technical** executives with the General Department and you will use the provided data and outside research to make recommendations about how the General Department might work to reduce traffic accidents in a **region of your choice**.

### Datasets

#### Provided Data

For this project, you'll have two provided datasets:

- [Traffic Accidents and Casualties by Region](./data/saudi-arabia-traffic-accidents-and-casualties-injured-dead-2008.csv)
- [Driving Licenses Issued By Administrative Area](./data/saudi-arabia-driving-licenses-issued-in-the-kingdom-2004-2008.csv)

You can see the source for the accident data [here](https://datasource.kapsarc.org/explore/dataset/saudi-arabia-traffic-accidents-and-casualties-injured-dead-2008/), and the source for the license data [here](https://datasource.kapsarc.org/explore/dataset/saudi-arabia-traffic-accidents-and-casualties-injured-dead-2008/). **Make sure you cross-reference your data with your data sources to eliminate any data collection or data entry issues.**

#### Additional Data

Please refer to the website of the General Department of Traffic [here](https://www.moi.gov.sa/wps/portal/Home/sectors/publicsecurity/traffic/!ut/p/z1/04_iUlDg4tKPAFJABjKBwtGPykssy0xPLMnMz0vM0Y_Qj4wyizfwNDHxMDQx8nZ3CTQ1cAz0dvX3dDE2MnA00vfSj8KvIDg1T78gO1ARAHn-YJg!/) for further investigation into policies and other data that may be of interest. **You may use any data that you locate additionally.**

### Deliverables

All of your projects will comprise of a written technical report. As we continue in the course, your technical report will grow in complexity, but for this initial project it will comprise:
- A Jupyter notebook that describes your data with visualizations & statistical analysis.
- A README markdown file the provides an introduction to and overview of your project.
- A blog post in Arabic or English that showcases the problem and key findings of this project. More information will be given on this.

**NOTE**: Your entire Github repository will be evaluated as your technical report. Make sure that your files and directories are named appropriately, that all necessary files are included, and that no unnecessary or incomplete files are included.

### Technical Report Starter Code

Future projects will require you to decide on the entire structure of your technical report. Here, we provide you with [starter code](./code/starter-code.ipynb) in a Jupyter notebook that will help to guide your data exploration and analysis. **If you choose to edit the core structure of this notebook, make sure you don't exclude any of the requested operations**.
